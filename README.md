This repository has two examples to show how to create a pdf at server side.

To run this, first install the node modules.
After cloning go to the repository and run :
- npm install puppeteer
- npm install handlebars
- npm install fs-extra
- npm install path

All the modules will be downloaded.
Now for creating a pdf from loading data from a url, go to folder websiteToPDF and run node knoldus.js command.
And for creating pdf from json go to foder jsonToPDF and run node main.js command.

That's all !
